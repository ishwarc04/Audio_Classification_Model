# 🌳 Forest Guardian AI

**Forest Guardian AI** is an AI-powered audio classification system designed to protect forest ecosystems from illegal logging and poaching. It uses a Deep Learning (CNN) model to analyze sound waves and detect specific threat signatures in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Performance Metrics
The model has been rigorously tested on original forest audio data and achieved a high degree of sensitivity and precision.

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- | 
| **Overall Accuracy** | **94.4%** |
| **Chainsaw Recall** | 95% |
| **Gunshot Recall** | 95% |
| **F1-Score (Weighted)**| 0.94.4 |

### Classification Breakdown
*   **Chainsaw**: High precision (95%) and perfect recall (95%).
*   **Gunshot**: Perfect precision and recall (95%).
*   **Heavy Machine**: Strong detection (93% precision, 94% recall).
*   **Normal Forest**: High accuracy in filtering ambient noise (95% recall).

## ✨ Features
*   **Real-Time Detection**: Web interface for instant audio analysis via Streamlit.
*   **Mel-Spectrogram Visualization**: Converts audio into "visual heatmaps" for the AI to analyze.
*   **Smart "Other" Categorization**: Uses a 65% confidence threshold to prevent false alarms from unknown sounds.
*   **Color-Coded Alerts**: Visual warnings (Red/Green) based on the threat level detected.
